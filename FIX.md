"Redesign the following website to make it look more modern, smooth, neat, and expensive. Use contemporary design principles: add subtle animations and smooth transitions, rounded corners for elements, clean typography with premium fonts like Inter or Playfair Display, a minimalist color palette with high-contrast accents (e.g., deep blues, golds, or neutrals for a luxurious feel), responsive layout for all devices, ample white space for elegance, and high-quality images or icons. Ensure the overall aesthetic feels premium and professional, like a high-end brand site. Output the updated HTML, CSS, and JS code, along with any suggestions for improvements."
